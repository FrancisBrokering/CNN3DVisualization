# CNN3DVisualization

CNN3DVisualization is a project that combines digit recognition with a captivating 3D visualization of the underlying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The project allows users to draw a digit, and the CNN model accurately predicts the drawn digit while showcasing its inner workings in a visually appealing 3D environment.

## Features

- Digit recognition: Users can draw a digit, and the CNN model accurately predicts the drawn digit.
- 3D visualization: The CNN model is visualized in a 3D environment using the powerful graphics library, Three.js.
- Live activation display: As the digit passes through the network, the corresponding layers and neurons light up to indicate their activation during the classification process.
- Interactive interface: Users can interact with the visualization, exploring the inner workings of the CNN model.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The CNN model and digit recognition are implemented using Python.
- Three.js: A powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the browser.
- HTML/CSS: The user interface is built using HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive interaction experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
